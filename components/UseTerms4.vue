                Privacy Policy

 <br /><br />
                1. Overview<br /><br />
                Shareity is a social donation service (the “Service”) accessible
                via web browser at shareity.com (shareity.com) (for information) or
                app.shareity.com (to participate in a challenge) or
                members.shareity.com (Dashboard to manage challenge and user data)
                (collectively the “Site”) operated by Shareity Inc. in the United
                States. We at  Shareity  respect your privacy. This Privacy Notice
                describes the personal information we collect about you, why we
                collect it, and how we use it. We primarily collect user
                information  in an effort to improve your experience and
                communicate with you about Causes and challenges, which we explain
                in more detail below. This Privacy Notice describes the choices
                you can make about how we collect and use your information. We do
                not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. This
                Notice does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not
                own or control, or to people whom we do not employ or manage.<br /><br />
                With respect to the collection of your information, if you do not
                want your personal information collected, please do not submit it
                to us. If you have already submitted information and would like to
                review, correct, or remove it from our records, please log in to
                your account or contact us via steve@shareity.com<br /><br />By
                visiting and using the Site, you are deemed to have agreed to the
                provisions of this Privacy Notice, unless you are in the EEA or
                Switzerland in which case you are acknowledging that you have been
                provided this Privacy Notice.   Terms of Use <br /><br />There
                are a few definitions we’d like to get out of the way (and repeat
                from the Terms of Use) so that you understand the way in which
                this Privacy Notice applies to you. A User is any individual who
                accesses the Site and uses the Service, regardless of whether it
                is on their own personal behalf or on the behalf of a Brand, Cause
                or Promoter. A User can be an individual challenge participant
                (“Participant”), an individual who contributes (“Sponsors”) a
                donation to a challenge campaign (“Cause”),the organizer of their
                own Cause or the (“Promoter”), marketing coordinator of campaigns.
                A Cause might more often be an organized not-for-profit,
                individual, charitable fund, governmental organization, or other
                entity but not necessarily so. Likewise, much of the time the
                Sponsor (“Brand”) of a challenge campaign will be a company,
                corporation, individual, government organization or charitable
                fund that has agreed to Sponsor the donation based on each
                Participant’s completion of the challenge.<br /><br />
                2. What Data Do We Collect?<br /><br />
                We don’t receive any identifiable personal data about you other
                than what you provide us, either by creating an account, using the
                Services, from Facebook when you agree to connect your Facebook
                account to Shareity, or data we can infer from your use of the
                Services. <br /><br />
                When you create a Shareity account: We will collect basic contact
                information about you to set up your account so you can manage a
                Brand’s donations, develop a challenge page for a Cause, or
                participate in a challenge. This may include your name, phone
                number, address and email address. For Shareity Database users we
                will also ask you to register a username and password so you can
                gain secure access to your account in the future.<br /><br />
                When you sign in to Shareity using your Facebook account: If you
                choose to login via Facebook, we will obtain access to your
                Facebook public profile information and email address. We will use
                this information to allow you to login and populate our records
                about you. If you give us permission (via Facebook’s preference
                settings), we may also obtain access to your friend list but we
                only receive the names of your friends who are
                also Shareity users. We will only use this to see if people on
                your friends list are also using our website and as set out in How
                we use personal information below. You can control whether or not 
                Facebook shares this data with us, either by changing your
                preferences when you first login to  Shareity with your Facebook
                account or by visiting the app setting controls on Facebook’s
                platform.<br /><br />When you complete a challenge: To enable
                us to process evidence of your Sponsoring a Cause through
                completion of a challenge, we will collect basic information
                associated with your challenge completion, such as phone number,
                email address or location (if elected for specific challenges).
                Your Picture/Video/Gaming/AR content of the challenge (“Challenge
                Content”) you completed will display on your social media account,
                text and email (if you choose to share). Challenge Content may
                also be used in Shareity for managing campaigns and promotional
                material. Although not required, as a general practice we ask
                Brand/Cause/Promoters to ask individuals about the use of their
                Challenge Content prior to using it in future promotions and
                campaigns. This can be done via  Shareity messaging in Shareity
                Dashboard. As with any platform when you share or post online it
                can be viewed or used by third parties via screenshot, so be
                mindful of this.<br /><br />When you create a Shareity
                Challenge: We will use the details you provided when you set up
                your account to create your  Shareity Challenge or challenge page.
                We will also collect details of the Cause or not-for-profit that
                you are supporting, or the details for your proposed challenge
                page. Where applicable, we will ask you to provide details of how
                and when you are intending to Sponsor and/or the occasion you are
                recognizing by carrying out the challenge.<br /><br />When you
                give us information about others: You may decide to provide us
                with information about others (or authorize us to collect this
                information on your behalf from your social networks or your
                contacts list) for example:<br /><br />so we can help you tell
                your friends and family about a Cause you are running or challenge
                you are carrying out; or if you start a Cause or a challenge for,
                or in the memory or in celebration of, another person<br /><br /> 
                You must ensure that they have agreed to you providing us with
                their information. Where required by local laws, we would advise
                you to keep a record of their agreement and provide them with a
                copy of, or link to, this Notice. This is especially the case if
                you provide us with sensitive information about them (e.g. a
                reference to an illness or health condition).<br /><br />You
                should also only contact individuals using the Services who you
                know would be happy to hear from you and must not use our Services
                to send unsolicited ‘SPAM’ messages. This is strictly enforced and
                users have the right to opt out of your campaign.<br /><br />If
                you create a Cause for a club, organization, body or association
                that is managed by someone other than yourself, you must ensure
                that the manager(s) of that club, organization etc. agrees to your
                fundraising (e.g. you are a member of a sports club and want to
                raise funds for a new clubhouse – you must seek the agreement of
                the sports club committee).<br /><br />When you use the
                Services: We also collect information about your use of our
                Services, including your URLs, IP address, mobile device
                identifier, how much time you spend on the Site, and what you do,
                like or view. We do this through the use of cookies. Our Site
                automatically logs indirect personal data from visitors. We
                consider indirect personal data to be data that does not clearly
                identify you but under some circumstances could. This sort of
                anonymous and indirect information include: URLs, IP addresses,
                operating system or platform identification information, browser
                identification information, information about the Internet
                website(s) from which a visitor may have linked to our Site,
                visitor activity on the Site, and the dates and times of Site
                visits and purchases. We collect and retain this type of
                information through the use of cookies and other technologies, to
                assist us in operating and improving the Site. We treat
                information collected by cookies and other technologies as
                non-identifying information. However, to the extent that Internet
                Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered
                personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as
                personal data. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal or
                indirect information is combined with personal data, we treat the
                combined information as personal data for the purposes of this
                Privacy Notice.<br /><br />Shareity and our partners (e.g.
                marketing partners) use a variety of technologies such as cookies,
                URL beacons, tags and scripts, to track Site performance, to make
                your visit better, and for aggregate Site/Challenge analytics.
                These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the
                Site, tracking Users’ movements around the Site and to gather
                demographic information about our User  base as a whole. We may
                receive reports based on the use of these technologies from our
                service providers or partners on an individual as well as
                aggregated basis. For example, the Site uses Google Analytics to
                measure web page views, performance, and such. To learn about how
                Google Analytics uses your information, visit the site “How Google
                uses Data when you use our partner’s sites or apps.”<br /><br />
                Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows
                you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and
                services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do
                not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities
                over time and across different websites.<br /><br />3. What
                Happens If You Don’t Want Us to Have Your Data?<br /><br />
                You are not required to provide personal data to us. Note,
                however, that your failure to do so may affect our ability to
                provide the Services you request (if you are a Brand, Cause or
                Promotor) and if you are a Participant your completion of a
                challenge necessarily involves the sharing of some personal data
                to authenticate challenge and facilitate donations. If, at any
                time, you are unsatisfied with Shareity or any parties using your
                data you may delete your account in Profile Settings. Once account
                is deleted all data (including picture and video links), impact
                and money raised (if it hasn’t already been donated) will be
                erased.<br /><br />4. How Do We Use Your Data?<br><br>Shareity uses
                your personal data to provide the Services you request, to
                personalize your  Shareity  experience, to send you communications
                and to enhance your ability to raise funds for the Causes you care
                about and to track your particular impact for a Cause (challenge

                them to you<br /><br />
                  We’ll also show you actions taken by people in your network,
                such as Social Media (Facebook, Instagram, SNAP, Twitter, etc) or

                5. With Whom Are We Sharing Your Data? <br /><br />We may disclose your
                data to our affiliated organizations and subsidiaries, and to
                service providers who render services to us or you on our behalf
                (all of which are contractually obligated to act only on our
                instructions and in accordance with applicable laws, such as the
                General Data Protection Regulation in the EU). We also may
                disclose your information if required by law, requested by law
                enforcement authorities or to enforce our legal rights, such as
                pursuant to a subpoena. We may share your information in
                connection with a sale or reorganization of Shareity, but in any
                such case, the terms of this Notice will continue to apply.<br /><br />
                Our service providers include:<br /><br />
                IT, information security and cloud services providers – to help us
                provide the Services and keep your data safe;<br /><br /> 
                communication providers – to assist us with the processing and
                delivery of email and other communications; <br /><br />
                behavioral analytics tools to collect and help us understand data
                when you use our Services, described in the How Do We Use Data?<br /><br />
                We also may share your personal data with<br /><br />
                Causes and Brands as follows:<br /><br />
                Causes: We share information, via Shareity Dashboard, details
                about donations made to them, including name and data associated
                with Participant Challenge Content and evidence of challenges
                completion. Causes who are registered with Shareity also have
                access to data about Sponsors so the Cause can understand who is
                fundraising for their benefit, Shareity ID for each user known to
                be linked to a specific phone number (WE NEVER SHARE PHONE
                NUMBERS), and challenge analytics on sharing impact, and user
                information provided via user opt in.<br /><br />
                Brands/Promoters: We share data, via Shareity Dashboard, with a
                Brand that Sponsors each Participant’s challenge so they can
                understand the demographics of who is completing challenges for
                their Causes and what donations must be relayed to the Cause. <br /><br /> 
                The data we share with Brands/Promoters includes the Cause’s name,
                the name and creation date of the challenge, the fundraising
                target, how much Participants’ have raised and the number of total
                challenges, challenge analytics on sharing an impact, Challenge
                Content,  a Shareity ID known to be linked to a specific phone
                number (WE NEVER SHARE PHONE NUMBERS), and user information
                provided via user opt in. <br /><br />6. How Do
                Causes/Brands/Promoters Use My Data?<br /><br />
                As stated above, unless you elect to be anonymous to which you
                Sponsor a donation or on whose behalf you complete a challenge, we
                will share evidence of your participation and Challenge Content.
                When we pass this personal data along via  Shareity Dashboard,
                subscribed Causes/Brands/Promoters also become controllers with
                respect to such personal data. This means that they’re responsible
                for their own compliance with applicable privacy and data
                protection laws when they use your personal data, and all such use
                is subject to the Cause’s own privacy notice. In certain
                jurisdictions such as the EU, when Causes receive your details,
                they are required to send you their privacy notice. Shareity is
                not responsible for participating organization’s use of your
                personal data or the participating organization’s compliance with
                applicable laws.<br /><br />When you Sponsor a Cause by
                participating in a challenge you could be asked whether or not you
                consent to receiving email from the participating organization
                about the impact of your donation and other ways to support them
                including future events, campaigns and appeals. If you opt in to
                receiving such emails, we will pass your consent preference on to
                that organization, if it is subscribed to receive such reporting
                from us. Note that the organizations will need to receive your
                personal data to send you emails you consent to receive.<br /><br />
                If you want to change your preferences for an organization to use
                your data (to contact you or otherwise), please contact the
                organization directly.<br /><br />If the organization you’re
                interacting with hasn’t subscribed to receive organization
                reporting from Shareity, that organization won’t have access to
                details about your consent preferences. This means that they won’t
                know if you have opted in or out of receiving email fundraising
                appeals.<br /><br />Note that participating organizations
                receive information about supporters from lots of different
                sources. We’re not the system of record for our organization
                partners. We cannot reflect any changes in your consent
                preferences that you make directly with the organization. For
                example, if you opt in to receive emails from an organization when
                you Sponsor a donation through Shareity, but then you subsequently
                opt out by telling the organization, Shareity won’t have a record
                that you opted out of receiving email from that organization. <br /><br />
                7. How Do We Use Personal Data of Our Brand, Cause or Promoter
                Users?<br /><br />
                If you work for a Cause, Brand or Promoter, we use your data in
                slightly different ways than for Participant users of the
                Services. <br /><br />We collect an organization (Cause, Brand,
                Promoter) user’s name, work email address, and office number. We
                use this data to enable you to sign into your account and to
                access the shareity.com (shareity.com) platform for reporting. In
                addition, we may use your data to perform business services you
                request. Finally, we will send you the following email
                communications: operational emails, customer service emails and
                business marketing emails. When you log into your account, you can
                opt out of receiving emails from us, other than service emails
                related to your requests. <br /><br />
                The following sections 8-11 are specific to Users in the EU. <br /><br />
                8. What Are Your EU Rights?<br /><br />
                Shareity  recognizes that your personal data belongs to you and we
                don’t wish to use it in ways that you don’t want us to.<br /><br />
                You can control whether or not you receive marketing email
                from Shareity by visiting your Account.<br /><br />You can also
                exercise a variety of rights regarding our use of your data:   You
                can ask us for a copy of the information we have about you <br /><br />
                You can ask us to correct any incorrect data we have about you and
                you can also update your account details yourself at any time by
                visiting your Shareity account<br /><br />You can ask us to
                delete your data, or do it yourself<br /><br />You can ask for
                your data in a common, machine-readable format   You can object to
                any processing we do on the basis of legitimate interests or to
                any automated decision-making   You can ask us to restrict the
                processing of your data   To exercise any of the foregoing rights,
                please contact us with your request. Note that some of these
                rights aren’t absolute—for example, we may not be able to delete
                all your personal data if we have to keep some of your data to
                comply with the law—but we’ll evaluate your request in accordance
                with applicable privacy and data protection laws. Shareity will
                respond to your request within one month of receiving it. Also,
                note that you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data
                protection supervisory authority in your country of residence or
                place of work.<br /><br />9. On What Legal Bases Do We Process
                Your EU Data?<br /><br />
                We process your personal data on a variety of legal bases
                depending on the use. For example, we will only process your
                personal data to send you direct marketing if we have your consent
                and you can withdraw this consent at any time opting out of
                receiving such emails. Sometimes it is necessary to process your
                data for us to comply with our legal obligations. Typically,
                though, we are processing your personal data in order to fulfill
                your request concerning our Services, management of a challenge,
                or coordinating with a sponsoring Brand. <br /><br />
                10. How Are We Using Your EU Data Based on Our Legitimate
                Interests?<br /><br />
                We may process your personal data for the purposes of our
                legitimate interests, provided that these uses aren’t outweighed
                by your rights or interests. For any uses we justify on the basis
                of legitimate interest, you have the right to opt out of such
                processing by contacting us, or doing so yourself.<br /><br /> 
                11. Are We Doing Any Automated Decision Making on EU Data?<br /><br />
                To help our Causes fundraise more effectively, we may employ
                machine learning and other analytics that make inferences about
                some characteristics of our Participants. We use these tools to
                tailor messages to you, to show and prioritize Causes we think
                you’ll be interested in, and make suggestions about how much you
                may want to participate in a challenge or donate. You can opt out
                of these processes at any time by contacting us.<br /><br />12.
                Where Are We Processing Your Data?<br /><br />
                We store and process all personal data relating to challenges and
                Users within the US. <br /><br />If you are visiting our Site
                from outside the United States, please be aware that your
                information will typically be transferred to, stored, and
                processed in the United States where our servers are located and
                our central database is operated. The privacy and data protection
                and other laws of the United States and other countries might not
                be the same as those in your country. Please be assured that we
                seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is
                protected. By using our Services, you understand that your
                information may be transferred to our facilities and those third
                parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy
                Notice.<br /><br />13. How Long Do We Keep Your Data?<br /><br />
                We keep your personal data in an identifiable form for as long as
                we have a legitimate reason to use the data and as required by
                law.<br /><br />14. How Do We Notify You of Changes to this
                Notice?<br /><br />
                We keep this Notice under regular review and place updates on the
                Site. We will also provide notifications of material changes via
                email or other channels. If you keep using the Services after we
                notify you, you consent to the updated Privacy Notice. If not, you
                may contact us.<br /><br />15. Contact Us<br /><br />
