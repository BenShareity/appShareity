          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Shareity is
              a social donation service (the “Service”) accessible via web browser at shareity.com (shareity.com) (for
              information) or app.shareity.com (app.shariety.com) (to participate in a challenge) or members.shariety.me

          </p>



          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">There are a
              few definitions we’d like to get out of the way. A User is any individual who accesses the Site and uses the
              Service, regardless of whether it is on their own personal behalf or on the behalf of a Brand, Cause or
              Promoter. A User can be an individual challenge participant (“Participant”), an individual who contributes
              (“Sponsors”) a donation to a challenge campaign (“Cause”), the organizer of their own Cause or the
              (“Promoter”), marketing coordinator of campaigns. A Cause might more often be an organized not-for-profit,
              individual, charitable fund, governmental organization, or other entity but not necessarily so. Likewise,
              much of the time the Sponsor (“Brand”) of a challenge campaign will be a company, corporation, or
              individual, government organization or charitable fund that has agreed to Sponsor the donation based on each
              Participant’s completion of the challenge.</span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">If you do
              not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not access or use the Service.</span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The Service
              and Site are protected by intellectual property laws worldwide. Nothing in these Terms of Use shall be
              deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits on any such content.</span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The Service
              allows Participants to direct donations by Brands in support of selected Causes as displayed in the Service.
              You acknowledge that the Cause that may be listed in the Site has subscribed to the Services on their own,
              and that SHAREITY MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING ANY PURPOSE, ITS VALIDITY, TAX-EXEMPT
              STATUS, OR ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE CAUSE. Only Causes that have subscribed and agreed to the
              Shareity Service may receive donations from a Participant’s use of the Service.<br /><br /></span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">A
              Participant does not have to contribute any funds themselves to participate in a challenge campaign,
              although they certainly may do so (becoming a “Sponsor”). We at Shareity have no role in or responsibility
              for the relationship between the Brand/Sponsor and the Cause nor do we guarantee fulfillment of the
              Brand/Sponsor/Promoter’s’s commitment to deliver the promised donations. Each Brand/Sponsor communicates
              directly with the Cause with respect to how and when the donation will be made, directly in our Shareity
              Dashboard. The Services provided under these Terms of Use are subject to payment of fees by the Brand to us
              (“Fees”). The amount of the Fees varies with each campaign, depending upon the members subscribed, actions,
              interactions, aggregate donation amount and the number of individual donations. The Fees that we charge a
              Brand are for management of the campaign and use of platform. <strong>We do not charge the Cause any fees
                for Brand Sponsored Challenges and neither request nor permit any deduction from the
                donation.</strong></span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Challenges
              are voluntary and elected. Shareity is not endorsing the use of the platform and or challenges for any other
              purpose other than raising money. Further Shareity does not protect or defend the integrity of any
              particular challenge, its purpose or outcome. Shareity does not recommend or take responsibility for any
              challenge ideas or their effects on society/users/causes/brands. Challenges should always be done with
              caution and awareness of surroundings, with regard to personal and public safety, property and human rights.
              Shareity is not liable for any damages or negative results from improper use of the platform by Users,
              Causes, Brands or Promoters, in connection with challenges or other promotional means. Alway use caution
              when planing, implementing or participating in a challenge.</span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">By agreeing
              to these Terms of Use, each Brand commits to paying the Fees to Shareity directly via payment processor,
              credit card, bank transfer or certified check in the form of (“Credits”) at the beginning of every campaign.
              One Credit is required for every participant added to the database (participating in the challenge). Credits
              must be bought before a campaign can become active in the database and Site. Credits must be for the full
              amount of the campaign for total anticipated Users. For example: Brand wants to donate $10,000 at $1 per
              user - they must purchase 10,000 Credits (total number or participants in the challenge). The price of
              credits may change based on demand and services provided. The current price of Credits as of this document
              dated above is ten cents ($0.10) per Credit. Credits can also be used to send out messages and rewards to
              users, buy Keywords, or start new campaigns. If Credits are not fully used in the intended campaign
              (campaign has ended or not reach a certain goal), they can be used in future campaigns, promotions, or
              outreach as they never expire.</span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span
              style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Participants may also receive benefits from a Brand, Cause,
              Promotor, or Shareity for completing a challenge (ie: rewards, messages, status ratings, SWAG). These
              rewards can be promotional material but cannot constitute SPAM. Shareity, a Brand, Cause, or Promoter may
              also conduct contests and/or sweepstakes through the Site, abiding by local governing laws and
              regulations.</span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">We expect
              that each participating Brand/Sponsor/Promoter will take every reasonable care to ensure that all donations
              and related transactions are conducted via a secure connection. However, the security of information and
              payments transmitted via the internet cannot be guaranteed. The Participant and Cause each acknowledges and
              agrees that: (i) donations are at a Brand’s own discretion; and (ii) we have no liability whatsoever for (a)
              any loss the Participant, Brand, or Cause may suffer if a Brand fails to fulfill its donation commitment or
              (b) if a third party obtains unauthorized access to any information provided by the User. </span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">By
              accepting these Terms of Use, each Brand/Sponsor commits and promises to deliver to the donation it has
              offered for each challenge campaign Cause. The donation commitment is described in each challenge campaign
              and set between the Brand and Cause during campaign Set Up. For example, a Brand may commit to deliver $1
              for each Participant who completes a challenge or a Brand may commit to deliver a certain amount of goods or
              services to the Cause if a certain number of challenges are completed. The Brand must convey its donation in
              a reasonable time following completion or end of the challenge campaign. Shareity may block a Brand from
              participating in future challenge campaigns if we have reason to believe that a Brand has not fully
              delivered on its donation commitment.</span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Each Brand
              and Cause licenses to Shareity any trademarks, trade names, logos and any other content it uploads to the
              Site for the challenge campaign (“Campaign Content”). Each Brand and Cause represents and warrants that it
              has all requisite rights to upload such content and shall indemnify Shareity for any expenses or losses
              arising from a third party’s claim that Campaign Content infringes its intellectual property rights. </span>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Each Brand,
              Cause or Promoter and Cause is responsible for using the Shareity Site and the Services in compliance with
              all applicable laws. Shareity is not responsible for identifying, assessing, or informing Users of which
              laws may apply in their use of the Site and the Service. Each Brand and Cause shall indemnify Shareity for
              any expenses or losses arising from use of the Service in violation of the laws of a particular

            <p style="font-size: 20px;" >Privacy Notice<br />Effective: March 1, 2019</p>
            <p>1. Overview<br />Shareity is a social donation service (the “Service”) accessible via web browser at
              shareity.com (shareity.com) (for information) or app.shareity.com (app.shariety.com) (to participate in a
              challenge) or members.shariety.me (members.shareity.com) (Dashboard to manage challenge and user data)
              (collectively the “Site”) operated by Shareity, LLC in the United States. We at Shareity respect your
              privacy. This Privacy Notice describes the personal information we collect about you, why we collect it, and
              how we use it. We primarily collect user information in an effort to improve your experience and communicate
              with you about Causes and challenges, which we explain in more detail below. This Privacy Notice describes
              the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information. We do not sell or rent your personal
              information to third parties. This Notice does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or
              control, or to people whom we do not employ or manage.
              <br />
              <br />
              With respect to the collection of your information, if you do not want your personal information collected,
              please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted information and would like to review, correct,
              or remove it from our records, please log in to your account or contact us via <a
                href="mailto:steve@shareity.com">steve@shareity.com</a>
              <br />
              <br />
              By visiting and using the Site, you are deemed to have agreed to the provisions of this Privacy Notice,
              unless you are in the EEA or Switzerland in which case you are acknowledging that you have been provided
              this Privacy Notice.
              <br />
              <a href="https://shareity.com/terms-and-conditions">https://shareity.com/terms-and-conditions</a>
              <br />
              <br />
              There are a few definitions we’d like to get out of the way (and repeat from the Terms of Use) so that you
              understand the way in which this Privacy Notice applies to you. A User is any individual who accesses the
              Site and uses the Service, regardless of whether it is on their own personal behalf or on the behalf of a
              Brand, Cause or Promoter. A User can be an individual challenge participant (“Participant”), an individual
              who contributes (“Sponsors”) a donation to a challenge campaign (“Cause”),the organizer of their own Cause
              or the (“Promoter”), marketing coordinator of campaigns. A Cause might more often be an organized
              not-for-profit, individual, charitable fund, governmental organization, or other entity but not necessarily
              so. Likewise, much of the time the Sponsor (“Brand”) of a challenge campaign will be a company, corporation,
              individual, government organization or charitable fund that has agreed to Sponsor the donation based on each
              Participant’s completion of the challenge.
            </p>

            <p>2. What Data Do We Collect?<br />
              We don’t receive any identifiable personal data about you other than what you provide us, either by creating
              an account, using the Services, from Facebook when you agree to connect your Facebook account to Shareity,
              or data we can infer from your use of the Services.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>When you create a Shareity account:</strong> We will collect basic contact information about you to
              set up your account so you can manage a Brand’s donations, develop a challenge page for a Cause, or
              participate in a challenge. This may include your name, phone number, address and email address. For
              Shareity Database users we will also ask you to register a username and password so you can gain secure
              access to your account in the future.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>When you sign in to Shareity using your Facebook account:</strong> If you choose to login via
              Facebook, we will obtain access to your Facebook public profile information and email address. We will use
              this information to allow you to login and populate our records about you. If you give us permission (via
              Facebook’s preference settings), we may also obtain access to your friend list but we only receive the names
              of your friends who are also Shareity users. We will only use this to see if people on your friends list are
              also using our website and as set out in How we use personal information below. You can control whether or
              not Facebook shares this data with us, either by changing your preferences when you first login to Shareity
              with your Facebook account or by visiting the app setting controls on Facebook’s platform.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>When you complete a challenge:</strong> To enable us to process evidence of your Sponsoring a Cause
              through completion of a challenge, we will collect basic information associated with your challenge
              completion, such as phone number, email address or location (if elected for specific challenges). Your
              Picture/Video/Gaming/AR content of the challenge (“Challenge Content”) you completed will display on your
              social media account, text and email (if you choose to share). Challenge Content may also be used in
              Shareity for managing campaigns and promotional material. As a general practice we ask Brand/Cause/Promoters
              to ask individuals about the use of their Challenge Content prior to using it in future promotions and
              campaigns. This can be done via Shareity messaging in Shareity Dashboard. As with any platform when you
              share or post online it can be viewed or used by third parties via screenshot, so be mindful of this.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>When you create a Shareity Challenge: </strong> We will use the details you provided when you set up
              your account to create your Shareity Challenge or challenge page. We will also collect details of the Cause
              or not-for-profit that you are supporting, or the details for your proposed challenge page. Where
              applicable, we will ask you to provide details of how and when you are intending to Sponsor and/or the
              occasion you are recognizing by carrying out the challenge.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>When you give us information about others: </strong> You may decide to provide us with information
              about others (or authorize us to collect this information on your behalf from your social networks or your
              contacts list) for example:
            <ul>
              <li>so we can help you tell your friends and family about a Cause you are running or challenge you are
                carrying out; or</li>
              <li>if you start a Cause or a challenge for, or in the memory or in celebration of, another person</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <br />
            You must ensure that they have agreed to you providing us with their information. Where required by local
            laws, we would advise you to keep a record of their agreement and provide them with a copy of, or link to,
            this Notice. This is especially the case if you provide us with sensitive information about them (e.g. a
            reference to an illness or health condition).
            <br />
            <br />
            You should also only contact individuals using the Services who you know would be happy to hear from you and
            must not use our Services to send unsolicited 'SPAM' messages. This is strictly enforced and users have the
            right to opt out of your campaign.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you create a Cause for a club, organization, body or association that is managed by someone other than
            yourself, you must ensure that the manager(s) of that club, organization etc. agrees to your fundraising (e.g.
            you are a member of a sports club and want to raise funds for a new clubhouse - you must seek the agreement of
            the sports club committee).
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>When you use the Services:</strong> We also collect information about your use of our Services,
            including your URLs, IP address, mobile device identifier, how much time you spend on the Site, and what you
            do, like or view. We do this through the use of cookies. Our Site automatically logs indirect personal data
            from visitors. We consider indirect personal data to be data that does not clearly identify you but under some
            circumstances could. This sort of anonymous and indirect information include: URLs, IP addresses, operating
            system or platform identification information, browser identification information, information about the
            Internet website(s) from which a visitor may have linked to our Site, visitor activity on the Site, and the
            dates and times of Site visits and purchases. We collect and retain this type of information through the use
            of cookies and other technologies, to assist us in operating and improving the Site. We treat information
            collected by cookies and other technologies as non-identifying information. However, to the extent that
            Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also
            treat these identifiers as personal data. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal or indirect information
            is combined with personal data, we treat the combined information as personal data for the purposes of this
            Privacy Notice.
            <br />
            <br />
            Shareity and our partners (e.g. marketing partners) use a variety of technologies such as cookies, URL
            beacons, tags and scripts, to track Site performance, to make your visit better, and for aggregate
            Site/Challenge analytics. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking
            Users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our User base as a whole. We may
            receive reports based on the use of these technologies from our service providers or partners on an individual
            as well as aggregated basis. For example, the Site uses Google Analytics to measure web page views,
            performance, and such. To learn about how Google Analytics uses your information, visit the site “<a
              href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">How Google uses Data when you use our partner’s
              sites or apps.</a>”
            <br />
            <br />
            Your browser may offer you a “<strong>Do Not Track</strong>” option, which allows you to signal to operators
            of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish
            such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.
            </p>
            <p>3. What Happens If You Don&rsquo;t Want Us to Have Your Data?<br />You are not required to provide personal
              data to us. Note, however, that your failure to do so may affect our ability to provide the Services you
              request (if you are a Brand, Cause or Promotor) and if you are a Participant your completion of a challenge
              necessarily involves the sharing of some personal data to authenticate challenge and facilitate donations.
              If, at any time, you are unsatisfied with Shareity or any parties using your data you may delete your
              account in Profile Settings. Once account is deleted all data, impact and money raised (if it hasn’t already
              been donated) will be erased.</p>

            <p>4. How Do We Use Your Data?<br />Shareity uses your personal data to provide the Services you request, to
              personalize your Shareity experience, to send you communications and to enhance your ability to raise funds
              for the Causes you care about and to track your particular impact for a Cause (challenge campaign).

              the terms of this Notice will continue to apply.
              <br />Our service providers include:
            </p>
            <p>&bull; IT, information security and cloud services providers – to help us provide the Services and keep
              your data safe;</p>
            <p>&bull; communication providers – to assist us with the processing and delivery of email and other
              communications;</p>
            <p>&bull; behavioral analytics tools to collect and help us understand data when you use our Services,
              described in the How Do We Use Data? Section.
              <br />We also may share your personal data with Causes and Brands as follows:
              <br /><strong>Causes:</strong> We share information, via Shareity Dashboard, details about donations made to
              them, including name and data associated with Participant Challenge Content and evidence of challenges
              completion. Causes who are registered with Shareity also have access to data about Sponsors so the Cause can
              understand who is fundraising for their benefit, Shareity ID for each user known to be linked to a specific
              phone number, and challenge analytics on sharing impact.
              <br /><strong>Brands/Promoters:</strong> We share data, via Shareity Dashboard, with a Brand that Sponsors
              each Participant’s challenge so they can understand the demographics of who is completing challenges for
              their Causes and what donations must be relayed to the Cause.
              <br />
              The data we share with Brands/Promoters includes the Cause’s name, the name and creation date of the
              challenge, the fundraising target, how much Participants’ have raised and the number of total challenges,
              challenge analytics on sharing an impact, Challenge Content and a Shareity ID known to be linked to a
              specific phone number.

              <br />6. How Do Causes/Brands/Promoters Use My Data?
              <br />As stated above, unless you elect to be anonymous to which you Sponsor a donation or on whose behalf
              you complete a challenge, we will share evidence of your participation and Challenge Content. When we pass
              this personal data along via Shareity Dashboard, subscribed Causes/Brands/Promoters also become controllers
              with respect to such personal data. This means that they’re responsible for their own compliance with
              applicable privacy and data protection laws when they use your personal data, and all such use is subject to
              the Cause’s own privacy notice. In certain jurisdictions such as the EU, when Causes receive your details,
              they are required to send you their privacy notice. Shareity is not responsible for participating
              organization’s use of your personal data or the participating organization’s compliance with applicable
              laws.

              <br />When you Sponsor a Cause by participating in a challenge you could be asked whether or not you consent
              to receiving email from the participating organization about the impact of your donation and other ways to
              support them including future events, campaigns and appeals. If you opt in to receiving such emails, we will
              pass your consent preference on to that organization, if it is subscribed to receive such reporting from us.
              Note that the organizations will need to receive your personal data to send you emails you consent to
              receive.
              <br />If you want to change your preferences for an organization to use your data (to contact you or
              otherwise), please contact the organization directly.
              <br />If the organization you’re interacting with hasn’t subscribed to receive organization reporting from
              Shareity, that organization won’t have access to details about your consent preferences. This means that
              they won’t know if you have opted in or out of receiving email fundraising appeals.

              <br />Note that participating organizations receive information about supporters from lots of different
              sources. We’re not the system of record for our organization partners. We cannot reflect any changes in your
              consent preferences that you make directly with the organization. For example, if you opt in to receive
              emails from an organization when you Sponsor a donation through Shareity, but then you subsequently opt out
              by telling the organization, Shareity won’t have a record that you opted out of receiving email from that
              organization.
            </p>

            <p>7. How Do We Use Personal Data of Our Brand, Cause or Promoter Users?
              <br />If you work for a Cause, Brand or Promoter, we use your data in slightly different ways than for
              Participant users of the Services.
              <br />
              We collect an organization (Cause, Brand, Promoter) user’s name, work email address, and office number. We
              use this data to enable you to sign into your account and to access the <a
                href="http://shareity.com">shareity.com</a> (<a href="http://shareity.com">shareity.com</a>) platform for
              reporting. In addition, we may use your data to perform business services you request. Finally, we will send
              you the following email communications: operational emails, customer service emails and business marketing
              emails. When you log into your account, you can opt out of receiving emails from us, other than service
              emails related to your requests.<br />

              <strong>The following sections 8-11 are specific to Users in the EU.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>8. What Are Your EU Rights?<br />
              Shareity recognizes that your personal data belongs to you and we don’t wish to use it in ways that you
              don’t want us to.
              <br />You can control whether or not you receive marketing email from Shareity by visiting your Account.
              <br />You can also exercise a variety of rights regarding our use of your data:
              <br />&bull; You can ask us for a copy of the information we have about you
              <br />&bull; You can ask us to correct any incorrect data we have about you and you can also update your
              account details yourself at any time by visiting your Shareity account
              <br />&bull; You can ask us to delete your data, or do it yourself
              <br />&bull; You can ask for your data in a common, machine-readable format
              <br />&bull; You can object to any processing we do on the basis of legitimate interests or to any automated
              decision-making
              <br />&bull; You can ask us to restrict the processing of your data
              <br />To exercise any of the foregoing rights, please contact us with your request. Note that some of these
              rights aren’t absolute—for example, we may not be able to delete all your personal data if we have to keep
              some of your data to comply with the law—but we’ll evaluate your request in accordance with applicable
              privacy and data protection laws. Shareity will respond to your request within one month of receiving it.
              Also, note that you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority in
              your country of residence or place of work.
            </p>

            <p>9. On What Legal Bases Do We Process Your EU Data?
              <br />We process your personal data on a variety of legal bases depending on the use. For example, we will
              only process your personal data to send you direct marketing if we have your consent and you can withdraw
              this consent at any time opting out of receiving such emails. Sometimes it is necessary to process your data
              for us to comply with our legal obligations. Typically, though, we are processing your personal data in
              order to fulfill your request concerning our Services, management of a challenge, or coordinating with a
              sponsoring Brand.
            </p>
            <p>10. How Are We Using Your EU Data Based on Our Legitimate Interests?
              <br />We may process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests, provided that these
              uses aren’t outweighed by your rights or interests. For any uses we justify on the basis of legitimate
              interest, you have the right to opt out of such processing by contacting us, or doing so yourself.
            </p>

            <p>11. Are We Doing Any Automated Decision Making on EU Data?<br />To help our Causes fundraise more
              effectively, we may employ machine learning and other analytics that make inferences about some
              characteristics of our Participants. We use these tools to tailor messages to you, to show and prioritize
              Causes we think you’ll be interested in, and make suggestions about how much you may want to participate in
              a challenge or donate. You can opt out of these processes at any time by contacting us.</p>
            <p>12. Where Are We Processing Your Data?
              <br />
              <strong>We store and process all personal data relating to challenges and Users within the US.</strong>
              <br />If you are visiting our Site from outside the United States, please be aware that your information
              will typically be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located
              and our central database is operated. The privacy and data protection and other laws of the United States
              and other countries might not be the same as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take
              reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is protected. By using our Services, you understand that
              your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as
              described in this Privacy Notice.
            </p>

            <p>13. How Long Do We Keep Your Data?<br />We keep your personal data in an identifiable form for as long as
              we have a legitimate reason to use the data and as required by law.
            </p>
            <p>14. How Do We Notify You of Changes to this Notice?<br />We keep this Notice under regular review and place
              updates on the Site. We will also provide notifications of material changes via email or other channels. If
              you keep using the Services after we notify you, you consent to the updated Privacy Notice. If not, you may
              contact us.</p>
